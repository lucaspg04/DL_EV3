i plan to travel around harvard university and know more about it . to tell you the truth , i plan to apply for harvard after graduation from high school . it s better to get to know it . what about you ? i get together with my christian brothers on saturdays . oh , my god ! john , i didn t know you are religious . you just look like a scientific kook , like leonard in the big bang theory . come on , han maimed , don t make a fuss . a lot of americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . but i m really surprised . i thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? yes , they are compatible . actually , the u . s . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . ive heard about it a little bit before , but i don t understand . how can people believe in god since they know god doesnt exist ? that s a little complicated . you ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the u . s . history later on . religion was and is a part of american people s life . guess what ? even harvard university , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . really ? absolutely ! it was founded by a group of puritan immigrants from england . why was it founded by the puritans ? where were the atheistic educators ? because most of the first english immigrants who came to the united states were puritans . how come ? i mean why most of them were religious people ? that s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in england . many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . so , you mean people didnt enjoy religious freedom in england ? yes , thats why puritans moved to the new world , where they believed they could establish a heaven for puritans . later on , it was these puritans who founded harvard college . why did they want to found a college ? many puritans had received classic style of higher education in oxford university and cambridge university back in england . they hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . oh , i see . actually harvard was first named new college , without a formal name . when did it begin to be called harvard university ? in 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor john harvard . interestingly , johnharvard himself was a clergyman . it seems that harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . therefore , it s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note harvard . wow , i didn t know that religion had played such an important role in harvard history . religion has been playing an indispensible part in harvard history as well as the u . s . i finally begin to get to know harvard . it seems that my knowledge of harvard is rather poor . i have a lot work to do before applying for harvard . remember that harvard is a part of the united states . so you have to know the u . s . history and culture if you want to have indepth knowledge of harvard . the two are closely related . that s right . i have a lot to learn from you . you can ask me any question at any time .',\n"," 'i am not convinced by your explanation . could you explain it ?

i hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but i doubt it ll happen before it s too late . we need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . there s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it s expensive . developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection . everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . it s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . countries and companies just want the wood . they re not thinking about the longterm damage to the forests . we should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life . in other parts of the world , especially in africa , there is a problem with desertification . climate change and overfarming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow enough food . it also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ?

La metrica que tiene mas relevancia en nustro casod e estudio es la de rouge-1 o L ya que Bleu lo que mide es la precision de las respuestas que en nuestro caso no es muy relevante. Por el contrario Rouge mide la capacidad del modelo de aprender a generar respuestas con los conceptos clave de las oraciones de referencia. Esto quiere decir que puede generar contenido nuevo pero siempre conservando las ideas clave de la referencia.\n","\n","    Entre rouge-L y rouge-1 la diferencia esta enq ue Rouge-L mide tambien el orden de las ideas que se generan.

Codigicar y decodificar son los pasos clave y que hacen la diferencia en estos modelos de deep learning, permitiendonos entregar una sequiencia de palabras y obteniendo una sequencia de respuesta.\n","\n","La calidad de las respuestas generadas (secuencias de salida), se puede medir con las metricas BLEU o ROUGE, utilizadas tambien en este estudio, las cuales mostraron resultados no muy favorables, a pesar que las respuestas generadas tienen algun grado de coherencia.\n","\n","¡Gracias por revisar nuestro proyecto!
